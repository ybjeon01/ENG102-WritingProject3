      <h1>The Dark Side Of The Korean Content Industry</h1>
      <p className="main3-example-content-explanation">
        Because the content industry in Korea is small, the drama and k-pop markets
        in Korea have somewhat unusual business models. Trying to get bigger profits
        from few customers, entertainment companies have gone to a strategy of maximizing
        Average Order Value. For example, the companies do not sell tickets for idol
        fansign events. Instead, the chance to get a ticket is given to people who buy
        music albums. One album is equal to one slot in the lottery, so the companies
        encourage fans to spend thousands of dollars just to get a ticket for the fansign
        event. Plus, Idols have a short lifespan. In order to maximize profits in a
        short period of time, some companies force idols to work tremendously. Also,
        according to a survey, 3 out of 10 people in drama industry have experienced
        late payment wages. Although Dramas are fun and idols look shiny, there is a
        dark side behind them.
